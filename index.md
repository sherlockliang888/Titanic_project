## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sherlockliang888/Titanic_project/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

# Titanic_project
ML math project
<p> 1. Use Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SGD, and SVM for classification of the dataset. </p>

<p> 2. Use GridSearchCV to tune the parameter of each of the above model, can you obtain better results in this step for any of the models? Disucss you observations.  </p>
<p> 3. Randomly (or based on some hypothesis) remove some columns (1,2 or maybe 3 of them) of the dataset features and re-run your classification models. Do you observe any change in classification metrics? </p>
<p> 4. Submit your project by the midnight of the 8th session. A suggested method is to submit a (text) report to discuss and summarize your findings and an .ipynb with clear comments and code sections to  present your work. </p>

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sherlockliang888/Titanic_project/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
