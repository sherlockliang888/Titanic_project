# Titanic Project

<p> 1. Use Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SGD, and SVM for classification of the dataset. </p>

<p> 2. Use GridSearchCV to tune the parameter of each of the above model, can you obtain better results in this step for any of the models? Disucss you observations.  </p>
<p> 3. Randomly (or based on some hypothesis) remove some columns (1,2 or maybe 3 of them) of the dataset features and re-run your classification models. Do you observe any change in classification metrics? </p>
<p> 4. Submit your project by the midnight of the 8th session. A suggested method is to submit a (text) report to discuss and summarize your findings and an .ipynb with clear comments and code sections to  present your work. </p>
